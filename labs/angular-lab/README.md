# Angular Weekend Lab

**Objective**: To build a full-featured, front-end application. Don't worry about persistent data. Use external APIs if you'd like to mock data into your own app.

## Background

Because Angular and other front-end frameworks allow you to build the entire front end agnostic to whatever server you use, it is good practice to build **Outside-In** completely, meaning you build out the client exactly the way it would look and work before starting on the server. In a way, your client begins to resemble a **full-featured prototype**. This process helps with client work because the client gets very excited seeing a prototype that is working and navigable, and it is easy to make rapid changes an Angular front end (while it is much harder to change the server and database structure).

## Requirements

Your app must be beautifully designed. Remember to make wireframes and use well-designed websites as inspiration. Your app should include 4 of the following 6 criteria:

* A custom angular directive
* An external angular directive (ng-map, ng-draggable, <a href="http://ngmodules.org" target="_blank">ng-modules</a>)
* An external API
* Any <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io">angular-ui modules</a>
* A Backend as a Service (see instructions below)

## App Ideas

You can make any app idea you like. You could even do a first pass at building the front end of your project 3. If you're having trouble coming up with ideas, remember to use Startup Ninja. Here are some suggestions for app ideas that you could build:

1. A Stack Overflow clone with questions, comments, answers, and votes.
1. A Disco-Rave app that plays music
1. <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-19-20/angular_hangman" target="_blank">A hangman game</a>
1. Any idea you'd like!

## Stretch: Backend as a Service

Once you've built the front end in Angular, depending on what you want your app to do, you could use a **Backend as a Service** to make your own custom back end very rapidly. The two major competitors in this space are <a href="https://www.firebase.com" target="_blank">Firebase</a> and <a href="https://parse.com" target="_blank">Parse</a>. To decide between them, just answer this question:

> Do I need asychronous communication with the server like chats?

If the answer is "Yes", then use Firebase. If "No", then use Parse.

Use their getting started docs to . . . get started.
