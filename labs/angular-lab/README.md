# Angular Weekend Lab

**Objective**: To build a full featured front end application. Don't worry about persistent data. Use external APIs if you want and mock data to your own API

## Background

Because Angular and other front end frameworks allow you to build the entire front end agnostic to whatever server you use, it is good practice to build **Outside-In** completely, meaning you build the client out exactly the way it would look and work before starting on the server. In a way your client begins to resemble a **full featured prototype**. This process helps with client work because the client gets very excited seeing a prototype that is working and navigable, and it is easy to make rapid changes an angular front end (while it is much harder to change the server and database structure).

## Requirements

Your app must be beautifully designed. Remember to make wireframes and use advanced websites as inspirations. Your app should include 4 of the following 6 options:

* A custom angular directive
* An external angular directive (ng-map, ng-draggable, [ng-modules](http://ngmodules.org/))
* An external API
* Add any [angular-ui modules](https://angular-ui.github.io/)
* A Backend as a Service (see instructions below)

## App Ideas

You can make any app idea you like. You could even do a first shot at building the front end of your project 3 project. If you're having trouble coming up with ideas remember to use App Ninja. Also here are some suggestions for app ideas that you could build:

1. A clone of stack overflow with questions, comments, answers, and votes
1. A Disco-Rave App that plays music
1. A game of hangman
1. Any idea you'd like!

## Stretch: Backend as a Service

Once you have built the front end in Angular, depending on what you want your app to do, you could use a **Backend As a Service** to make your own custom back end very rapidly. The two major competitors in this space are [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) and [Parse](https://parse.com/). To decide between them, just answer this question:

```
  Do I need asychronous communication with the server like chats?
```

If the answer is "Yes" the use Firebase. If "No" then use Parse.

Use their getting started docs to . . . get started.
