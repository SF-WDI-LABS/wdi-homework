| Add an external directive to your Angular project |
| Make your own custom angular directives |

# Challenge

## Base Challenges

1. If you haven't already, load the `currentWeather` directive into an angular app and get it to work.
2. Pull out the template into a different file and use the `templateUrl` option.
3. Improve the template and show more information from inside the `weather` JSON.
5. Add [angular-input-match](http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-input-match) to add a validation to make the password confirm field match the password field. (remember, add the files, then link with the <script> tag in index.html, then inject into your app, now use in your views.)
7. Add [ngMap](https://github.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps) to display a map on your angular app centered on SF.

## Evening Challenges

4. Create a directive called `5-day-forecast` and fetch and display the 5 day forecast from the openweathermap api.
7. Add [angular-moment](https://github.com/urish/angular-moment) to make a date and time directive that ticks down by the second.
8. Find and implement an edit-in-place directive.
7. Come up with an idea for a custom directive and implement it. For a bonus, use an external API like the weather example above.
