Usability or User Experience Design (UX) is an important discipline for all software developers to be familiar with. To become an expert is UX takes years of dedicated study, curation, and actual designing and working. However, to become familiar with a few basic UX principles will give you a language to talk about UX.

## That's Just Your ... Opinion ... Man

User experience is **NOT a Matter of Opinion** although when we are not trained it seems like personal preference to have things work one way or another. Avoid treating UX as a matter of opinion and if others treat it that way, strive to elevate UX decisions to a discussion of objective topics: trends in web design, project business goals, and key metrics.

## The Process

1. Write user stories.
1. Find inspirations in similar or competitor websites.
  - In order to be very creative
1. Decide on key metrics and key user actions
  - (e.g. signing up, subscribing, creating a post, posting a comment, voting, adding something to your shopping cart)
1. Draw multiple iterations of wireframes.
  - Wireframes are a huge opportunity to quickly iterate through many various layout concepts. You can change drawn wireframes 100X faster than you can update layouts in code!

## Call to Action

One fundamental prinicple in UX design is the **Call to Action**. Can you identify the calls to action on these pages?
