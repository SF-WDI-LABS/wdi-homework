# Angular Directives

Angular is made up of directives that supercharge your html. Some of them you already know like `ng-app`, `ng-click`, `ng-controller`, and `ng-model`. You can also make your own custom directives, but Angular also ships with a slew of very useful ones. To understand Angular directives better, lets look at some of the basic "native" Angular directives.

**Follow Along** - please create a basic angular project in an `index.html` page and follow along with these examples by copying them into your code and trying them out.

## ng-include

With the `ng-include` directive Angular allows you to use partial templates like we've see with underscore, handlebars, and rails. Try out this example. Careful to remember to include the single quotes inside the double quotes.

```html
  <ng-include src="'navbar.html'"></ng-include>
```
> **Watch out!** if you don't run a server with `http-server`, you can't have templates be in separate folder, they have to be inline like in underscore.

You can also use `ng-repeat` and `ng-include` together.

```html
  <ng-include src="'article.html'" ng-repeat="article in articles"></ng-include>
```

## Validation

Angular gives you some easy to use form validations if you use the `ng-submit` and the `ng-disabled` directives. `ng-submit` lets you add inline validators like `required` and `ng-minlength` and `ng-maxlength`.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class='col-sm-4 col-sm-4-offset'>
    <form name="login_form" ng-submit="login()">
      <div class='form-group'>
        <label>Email</label>
        <input class='form-control' type="email" placeholder="Email" name="email" ng-model="user.email" required>
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label>Password</label>
        <input class='form-control' type="password" placeholder="Password" name="password" ng-model="user.password" ng-minlength=6 required />
      </div>
      <button class='btn btn-primary' type="submit" ng-disabled="login_form.email.$invalid || login_form.password.$invalid">Login</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Filters

Angular gives you a handful of standard [filters](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter).

#### `currency`
Formats a number as a currency (ie $1,234.56). When no currency symbol is provided, default symbol for current locale is used.

```js
{{amount | currency}}
// $1,234.56
```

#### `date`

```js
{{'1288323623006' | date:"MM/dd/yyyy 'at' h:mma"}}
// 10/28/2010 at 8:40PM
```

#### `filter`

A standard filter lets you dynamically filter `ng-repeat` lists. Let's look at the syntax.

The below code outputs a list of people with their phone numbers that we can filter by a search input. The `ng-init` directive initializes the template with the array of data (this is not normally done! Usually this data would come from a controller). The `searchText` variable in $scope becomes our filter in the `ng-repeat` directive.

```html
<div ng-init="friends = [{name:'John', phone:'555-1276'},
                         {name:'Mary', phone:'800-BIG-MARY'},
                         {name:'Mike', phone:'555-4321'},
                         {name:'Adam', phone:'555-5678'},
                         {name:'Julie', phone:'555-8765'},
                         {name:'Juliette', phone:'555-5678'}]"></div>

<label>Search: <input ng-model="searchText"></label>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Phone</th>
  </tr>
  <tr ng-repeat="friend in friends | filter:searchText">
    <td>{{friend.name}}</td>
    <td>{{friend.phone}}</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
